Scripts for analyzing the APC dataset
How well can we predict wormbase annotations? 
How many genes are poorly predicted?
How many isoforms are likely NMD candidates?
How many times the APC algorithm predict the correct top isoform?
Does a low Manhattan distance always mean the top isoform is predicted?
